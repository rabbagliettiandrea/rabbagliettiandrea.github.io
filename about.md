I love to embed processes in a fancy way that let companies leverage the real tech deal.

I can define myself an IT Architect and Technical Project Manager, specialized in Python projects agile at scale but at the same time I do strongly believe that there isnâ€™t the right tool for all, there is the right tool for the right task.
I have a robust knowledge of Linux servers management, dev-ops automation tasks and application environment deployment. My particular experience and an in depth knowledge of IT issues, makes me capable of a great integration skill with teams.

Also, I really love cloud architecture, distributed-systems, big-data, server-side caching optimization (with some cool stuff like Redis.io) and scalability.
